# ReadmeAgent

## Overview

ReadmeAgent is a project designed to automate the generation of professional README.md files for software projects. It leverages multiple agents, each with a distinct responsibility to ensure the README is comprehensive, clear, and structured properly.

### Key Features

- **File Viewer Agent:** Analyzes the project directory, reading and interpreting files to write structured notes.
- **Write Agent:** Generates a detailed and well-structured README.md file using the notes provided by the File Viewer Agent.
- **Review Agent:** Reviews the generated README for completeness, clarity, and technical accuracy before finalizing.
- **Search Agent:** Supports the README generation by performing external web searches to fill in gaps or clarify complex concepts.

## Getting Started

To set up ReadmeAgent and generate a README for a new project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the ReadmeAgent repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script, specifying the path to the project directory you wish to analyze.

Example command:

```bash
python main.py --path /path/to/project
```

Once the process completes, a `README.md` file will be generated in the specified project directory.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script with the path to the target project directory.

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--path", required=True, type=str, help="READMEÎ•º ÏûëÏÑ±Ìï† ÌîÑÎ°úÏ†ùÌä∏ Í≤ΩÎ°ú")
args = parser.parse_args()

# Call the main function to start the agent workflow
asyncio.run(main(args.path))
```

### Parameters

- `--path`: Path to the directory of the project for which the README needs to be generated.

## Folder Structure

```text
ReadmeAgent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Auto-generated README file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py            # Entry point of the project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs.py         # Configuration settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools.py           # Definitions for various functions and classes
```
